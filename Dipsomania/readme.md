# Dipsomania through-hole adapter for SO-8 ICs and transistor arrays.

![3d render of completed Dipsomania v0.1](DIPSOmania_v01.png)

This little PCB allows use of SO-8 ICs in breadboards and in standard 0.3" row-spaced through-hole footprints as well as some IC sockets (probably not the fancypants machined pin socket types though).

<b>v0.1 (first source publication):</b> 

Here we go!

<b>v0.11:</b> 

-widened the DIP socket holes by 5 mils to actually fit pin headers;

-layout tweaks to ensure compatibility with JLCPCB design rules.
